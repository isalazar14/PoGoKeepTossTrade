## Pokemon Go Keep-Toss-Trade (aka PoGo Bag Manager)
#### Declutter your pokemon bag

Decide what to keep, toss, or trade based on the following calculations*:
  - Stat product rankings
  - Dust cost for Great League, Ultra Leage, and level 40
  - Potential trade results
* for each pokemon, and its possible evolutions
 
Useful for:
  - During/after catching sprees (for example, Comm Day)
